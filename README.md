# eSYS24
## Overview
Electronic System based on 2.4GHz communication. The Project is developed using the most popular GHz transceiver in the market, the NRF24L01, and controlled by STM32F103Cx.

# Hardware
eSWITCH24 and eCONTROL24 schematic is in .[hardware](../hardware). You can download PCB [Transceiver](../hardware/Transceiver/PCB_Files) and [Receiver](../hardware/Receiver/PCB_Files) designs files to build your eSYSTEM fully. If you'll fabricate the boards, I recommend use the [JLC7628 Stackup](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/impedance?_ga=2.116811712.798095935.1647969093-664896489.1639745533) from JLCPCB.

# Firmware
Both Codes were written in the Arduino IDE. The Codes and the libs are available to download [here](../firmware).
